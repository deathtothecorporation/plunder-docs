# Overview

**TODO:**

* include the docker images now that those exist https://github.com/deathtothecorporation/pallas-docker?tab=readme-ov-file#just-gimmie-a-sire-repl

The goal of this document is to get you from "I have no idea what this system is" to a simple "Hello world" web app.

The PLAN for this not-so-quick-start is:

1. Get familiar with enough of the Sire language to be immediately useful
2. Gather enough context about how IO and Cogs work to have a decent mental model of what's going on when you build one
3. Write a simple Cog from scratch

We'll start off here with a very high-level overview of what Plunder is (although we won't try to convince you _here_ of why you should care) and how it roughly works at this point in time. There will be links out to deeper dives on some topics, but we recommend you first go through the main path of these docs before you deepen your understanding of any given core concept.
