# Plunder vs Pallas

{% hint style="warning" %}
TODO:
- Why does the Pallas fork exist
  - Plunder is moving towards freezing ASAP. This is a mismatch with certain features that make it more usable _now_. Ultimately, Vaporware will be built on the frozen Plunder base, but for now we may have to make some changes on our fork that would interrupt the proper thrust of Plunder core development.
