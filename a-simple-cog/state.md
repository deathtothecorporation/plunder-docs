{% hint style="warning" %}
TODO: use `sire/vc_site_with_state.sire` as an example.

Pull out example sections of:
- [ ] initial state
- [ ] GET requests querying state
- [ ] POST requests updating state
- [ ] mention how "user uploaded files" works
- [ ] briefly show the js and how the requests are made and UI updated (but this
    isn't a js tutorial)
{% endhint %}
